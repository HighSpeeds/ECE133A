\subsection*{(c)}
We have that 
$$R_11=1$$
And thus 
$$R_{1,2:3}=[0,1]$$
Thus now we need to compute the cholensky factorization of 
$$\begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 1\\
    1 & a
\end{bmatrix}-\begin{bmatrix}
    0 & 1\\
    1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0\\
    0 & a
\end{bmatrix}$$
Thus we have that 
$$R_{22}=1$$
And thus we have that 
$$R_{23}=0$$
And thus we have that
$$R_{33}=\sqrt{a}$$
Thus we have that A is positive definite if and only if $a\geq0$, and if it 
exists we have
$$R=\begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 1\\
    0 & 1 & 0\\
    0 & 0 & \sqrt{a}
\end{bmatrix}$$
\subsection*{(e)}
We have that 
$$R_11=\sqrt{a}$$
thus we must have that $a\geq 0$, and thus we also have that 
$$R_{1,2:3}=[\frac{1}{\sqrt{a}},0]$$
Therefore we have that we want to find the cholesky factorization of
of 
$$\begin{bmatrix}
    -a & 1\\
    1 & a
\end{bmatrix}-\begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{1}{a} & 0\\
    0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}
    -a-\frac{1}{a} & 1\\
    1 & a
\end{bmatrix}$$
This cannot be factorized since we already have 
that $a\geq 0$ and thus we have that $-a-\frac{1}{a}\leq 0$. Thus we have
that A is not positive definite.
\subsection*{(h)}
We have that 
$$R_11=1$$
And thus
$$R_{1,2:3}=\frac{1}{1}A_{1,2:3}=[1,1]$$
Thus we have that we want to find the cholesky factorization of
$$\begin{bmatrix}
    a & a\\
    a & 2
\end{bmatrix}-\begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 1\\
    1 & 1
\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}
    a-1 & a-1\\
    a-1 & 1
\end{bmatrix}$$
Thus we have that
$$R_{22}=\sqrt{a-1}$$
And thus we have that
$$R_{23}=\frac{a-1}{\sqrt{a-1}}=\sqrt{a-1}$$
Thus in order for these to exist we must have that $a\geq 1$, and thus we have
that 
$$R_{33}=\sqrt{1-a-1}=\sqrt{-a}$$
This cannot exist, since we have already shown that $a\geq 1$, and thus we have
that A is not positive definite and that the cholesky factorization does not
exist.
