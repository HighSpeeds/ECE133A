\subsection*{(a)}
With the following julia code we get:
\lstinputlisting[
    basicstyle=\tiny, %or \small or \footnotesize etc.
]{problem1.jl}
that 
$$\theta_1=3.125592633829346$$
and 
$$\theta_2=0.1540181798438225$$
which results in the following fit:\\

\subsection*{(b)}
From our fit we expect the number of transistors to be:
$$10^{\theta_1+\theta_2(2015-1970)}\approx 10^{10}$$
Which is more than the acutally number of $4\cdot 10^9$ transistors:
\subsection*{(c)}
This is in line with Moore's law since
$2\theta_2=0.30803635968$ which is close to $\log_{10}(2)=0.30102999566$
